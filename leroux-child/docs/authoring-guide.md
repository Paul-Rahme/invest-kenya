# Invest Kenya Website — Authoring Guide

This document is a **hands‑on writing and publishing guide** for editors. It focuses on *how to prepare content*, *how to enter it*, and *how to keep everything consistent* across the site.

## 1) Before You Start (Content Preparation)

### ✅ Text content
- **Headlines:** keep them short and strong. If a headline is split into two parts, make sure each part makes sense on its own.
- **Short descriptions:** aim for 1–3 sentences. People scan these sections quickly.
- **Numbers and statistics:** verify accuracy and keep formatting consistent (e.g., “$2.5B” not “2.5 billion”).

### ✅ Images and icons
- **Use consistent sizes** within a section (especially in icon grids and tabbed galleries).
- **Avoid heavy files**; use compressed images when possible.
- **Keep icon style consistent** (same look and stroke style).

## 2) Editing Workflow (Step‑by‑Step)

### Editing a page
1. Go to **Pages** in WordPress.
2. Open the page you want to update.
3. Scroll to **custom fields** and update the content there.
4. Click **Update**.

### Editing a post (News / Events / Resources / Governance / Careers)
1. Go to the relevant post type (e.g., **Posts** for News).
2. Duplicate a similar post to keep styling consistent.
3. Edit the new post’s title, content, and custom fields.
4. If the post has an Elementor layout, open it in **Elementor** and update only the content blocks.
5. Save and update.

## 3) Writing Style Guidelines

### Keep it readable

## 4) Common Content Patterns

### Split titles
Some titles are visually split into two parts. When writing these:
- Part 1: Strong, bold keyword or phrase.
- Part 2: Supporting phrase (lighter tone).

### Statistics blocks
- Keep numbers short and impactful.
- Always include a short explanation or label.

### Tabbed content
- Each tab should cover a distinct topic.
- Keep the content balanced across tabs.
